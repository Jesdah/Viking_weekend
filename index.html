            <h3>Welcome to our summer camp "Viking Weekend" for children between 6 and 11 years old!</h3>

                <p>
                    Here we let the children live out their Viking fantasies while at the same time learning what made
                    the
                    Vikings special, everything from sailing, building their own shields to camaraderie.
                    <br>
                    As a parent/guardian, <em>it is important that your child/children bring "weather-appropriate
                        clothing" as
                        well as a sleeping bag and sanitary products such as a toothbrush and toothpaste,</em> 
                        <br>then
                    you as
                    a
                    parent/guardian can feel secure that our trained child educators will take care of your/ your
                    children.
                    From ten years of experience, we can guarantee that "Viking Weekend" creates memories, knowledge and
                    friendships that will last a lifetime.
                    <br>
                    Welcome!
